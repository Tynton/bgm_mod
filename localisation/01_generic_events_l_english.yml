 BGMHeresy.d.1:0 "Grzegorz Paweł z Brzezin, founder of the Polish Brethren, was a Socinian Polish religious scholar. The Unitarian movement do not believe in the Holy Trinity, or the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Gregory would preach to an early iteration of utopianism, for he maintains a viewpoint of stateless egalitarianism. The Unitarians themselves also believed in Religious Liberalism and rationality as the forefront of their morality."

 BGMHeresy.t.2:0 "The Anabaptist Movement"
 BGMHeresy.d.2:0 "There are several theories as to the origins of the Anabaptists. One maintains their foundation in Zurich. They did, however, begin movements strategically in large cities within Germany and the Netherlands. Although they did not seize control of any country, they may attempt to do so peacefully. However, they were persecuted in reality by most other notable denominations of Christianity in which they operated."

 waldensianEvents.1.t:0 "The Waldensian Faith"
 waldensianEvents.1.d:0 "The Waldensians are a Protestant precursor movement founded by Peter Waldo in the late 12th century. Initially the Catholic Church only took issue to Waldo and his followers' not having a formal Church license for proselytizing. As time went on the rift between Waldensians and the Catholic Church grew greater until hostilities emerged that would last for centuries. Later, though, the Waldensians were mostly (though not entirely) absorbed into Protestant denominations. They were mostly secretive on the basis of religious persecution."

He was inspired by a sermon in Saint Alexius, his rejection of Transubstantiation, and the sudden death of a friend. These convinced Waldo to live a devoted Christian life, of which he sold most of his belongings and preached his own religious interpretations."

 PreProtestantEvent.2.d:0 "Lollards have been protected in $COUNTRY$ for long enough that they have seized considerable political power and have acted on $MONARCH$ to convert or, at the very least, allow the Lollards complete freedom. In addition some of the nobility have joined their cause and the merchant class has been split but remains mostly apathetic. The clergy, however, will be upset and will request a Papal intervention."

 PreProtestantEvent.12.t:0 "The Conquest of Rome"
 PreProtestantEvent.12.d:0 "The Fraticelli have been successful in removing the impurities known as the Catholic Church from Rome. It would only be natural in these traditions that a new pope, sympathetic to this ideology be granted the seat of the former Catholic Church instead of seizing it for ourselves."

Now there is a sizeable nation which has embraced the One True Faith. The Fraticelli have confronted us with a request to found a sovereign entity for them to perform their work.

We have successfully flown a probe past Mars and have imaged it and will continue studying it for quite a while longer. It may take generations before we have exhausted all potential exploratory gain from this world. But scientists believe Mars to be the easiest in-solar system candidate for terraformation, something that could be considered later in the future."

 space_probe_flyby.d.2:0 "Mars was the first logical consideration for a probe flyby. Now we should turn our attention inward, to Venus. Although it is the most inhospitable terrestrial planet in the solar system, it still holds significance. For one, its day is comparable in timespan to its year, its lower atmosphere contains caustic material and its surface is the hottest in the solar system. To colonize Venus we should master the art of unconventional space technology, a true mastery to attain."

Mercury, the first planet in the solar system with a year of only under three months and without atmosphere, is also most reminescent to the Moon around the homeworld. Its daytime is exceptionally hot but its nighttime surface is quite cool.

 space_probe_flyby.d.4:0 "The Colossal, most masculine object in the solar system, Jupiter. It prevents the formation of a terrestrial planet between Mars and itself due to its impeding gravitational field. It brings with it a concubine of moons. Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto are simply the primary Galilean moons but there are many captured asteroids orbiting the solar titan. Also accompanying Jupiter are dark rings and a number of storm systems, most notably the Great Red Spot, an extraterrestrial hurricane noted as far back as even Galileo himself. Now we can explore this mysterious world and unfold the secrets of what may be the most curious planet we currently know near us."

It has the most rounded moons of any object in the solar system, from Mimas to Titan - the most exotic moon we know - to Iapetus, and much like Jupiter it carries an army of minor moons both within its vast rings and in its general gravitational influence. Unlike Jupiter its surface appears much smoother with less noticeable cloud bands."

 space_probe_flyby.n.7:0 "Neptune Flyby"
 space_probe_flyby.d.7:0 "Neptune, a perhaps surreal planet in some form. Its winds are the strongest around despite being the furthest from the Sun. Normally the cold would not allow pressure gradients that would generate the violent winds we're detecting, so a source of heat must be coming from within. Its rings have only now been discovered as was the case with Uranus. The rings are merely small, light-absorbing low albedo asteroids from what we could only guess was a moon passing within the Roche limit - a limit for a large (relatively) object to pass through before it rotates too quickly and breaks apart as a consequence."
 space_probe_flyby.7.a:0 "It is strangely reminescent of a star - with its internal heat outmatching the heat from the Sun, though distant."
 
 space_probe_flyby.n.8:0 "Solar Exit"
 space_probe_flyby.d.8:0 "Our probe has left Neptune and the Solar System. It now travels toward the Oort cloud and has several generations of power remaining. There will be some time to make discoveries, but by the time our probe reaches another solar system, it will be a relic of an ancient, long gone past for another civilization. It's a pessimistic assumption, but the other possibility is that it may be retrieved by humans later on and recovered for what it was known for. Things like the Golden Record may be deciphered by extraterrestrial life at some time givne the appropriate technology and interpretation mechanisms."

Though parliamentarism has been around in one form or another for nearly as long as civilization, enlightenment philosophers popularized it throughout the 1600's and 1700's.
