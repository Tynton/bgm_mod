 GER_culture_3_2_title:0 "Enlightenment in Germany"
 GER_culture_3_2_desc:0 "The new ideas of the Enlightenment are popularizing in Europe.

 GER_culture_3_3_title:0 "Dichter und Denker"
 GER_culture_3_3_desc:0 "Germany was known as 'Land der Dichter und Denker', or 'Land of Writers and Thinkers'.

From the sciences to philosophy, we can enjoy the glory these things bring."
 GER_diplomatic_security_title:0 "Diplomatic Security"
 GER_diplomatic_security_desc:0 "Germany's security can't come solely from its military capabilities. To disincentivize foreign invasion we need to build a strong alliance bloc."

 GER_idealism_title:0 "German Idealism"
 GER_idealism_desc:0 "Romanticism in philosophy and the arts has been an aspect of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ intellectual thought. From analysis of the thesis to antithesis, we can receive the synthesis. And thus comes a more full understanding with a new tool in epistemiology."
 GER_mil_theory_title:0 "Military Theory"
 GER_mil_theory_desc:0 "In North Germany lies a region with a reputation for militarism. Paired with ever-changing ideas on all things including war and we facilitate an apportionment of society whose dedications are to the art of war."

 GER_religious_debate_title:0 "Religious Debate"
 GER_religious_debate_desc:0 "Morality in $COUNTRY$ is being contested by Enlightenment ideas. The Kulturkampf is still in full force and we must choose a side in the otherwise inconclusive debate on morality in the long run."

 GER_resolve_kulturkampf_desc:0 "$COUNTRY$ has finally shaped a new, modern and coherent social structure. The Kulturkampf must end and a new age of Germanic prosperity must follow."
 GER_reich_chancellery_title:0 "Reichskanzlei"
 GER_reich_chancellery_desc:0 "The Reichskanzlei, or Reich Chancellery, was an office for the Chancellor of Germany to act with the endorsement of the Emperor. We need to appoint a new Chancellor to aid our ruler in their work."
 GER_humboldt_title:0 "Renovate Humboldt"
 GER_humboldt_desc:0 "Humboldt University is perhaps the best known institution of higher learning in Germany, perhaps even beyond. In the wake of the previous social revolution the University can be used not just for scientific achievement but also as a means to demonstrate the prestige of modern Germanic society."
 GER_modernizing_society_title:0 "Modernizing Society"
 GER_modernizing_society_desc:0 "A culture resentful of criminal activity, favoring great intellectual and philosophical achievement, and on the forefront of scientific endeavors has manifested and metaphorically dazzles the rest of the world with stability and achievement as it is paired with a rising star in the geopolitics of the world."
 GER_everlasting_culture_title:0 "Everlasting Homogeneity"

 GER_ind_2_title:0 "Imperial Cities"
 GER_ind_2_desc:0 "In centuries past it was regions like France or Italy who held control over some of the world's most important cities. Cities which have had great reputations for tourism and trade as well. We'd be lying if we said we weren't envious of this, but it's not that we can't make it so that in the future cities like Paris or Rome are the most known. Soon it will be $CAPITAL$ which takes the cake."
 GER_ind_3_title:0 "Industrial Agriculture"
 GER_ind_3_desc:0 "It'd be foolish to assume that applications of industrial processes and material are only ever present in the stereotypical factories or mines. Industrialization has just as much to offer the farmer as the factory worker."
 GER_ind_4_title:0 "Attract Foreign Capital"
 GER_ind_4_desc:0 "With great foundries and entire industrial regions, $COUNTRY$ can open its doors to foreign investment and dominate not only in the realm of war but also in peace."
 GER_ind_4_1_title:0 "Industrialized Saxony"
 GER_ind_4_1_desc:0 "Saxony was one of the first areas of Germany to fully embrace the Industrial Revolution. Let's continue a project of development and demonstrate to the rest of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ society that they too can prosper like the Saxons."
 GER_ind_4_2_title:0 "$CAPITAL$ Industrial Area"

 GER_ind_4_3_title:0 "Rhine Heartland"
 GER_ind_4_3_desc:0 "An area adjacent to an already prosperous region with many great cities, the Rhineland has every ingredient for a diverse and powerful economy. We'd be fools not to exploit this to its greatest potential."

Others believe that the Reich's economy would be improved by expanding the labor force and consumer market with social egalitarian constitutional aspects. Finally, the rest maintain that a new constitution should uphold the religious values in the greater realm."

 GER_rev_2_2_cm_title:0 "Stabilize Society"
